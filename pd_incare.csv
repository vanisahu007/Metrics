Talked with mom about other options such as WIC lactation consultant, Mercy lactation consult on the phone/support groups, and gave lactation consultant resource page with contact info for Blank and other organizations for lactation assistance.\n\nSpent some time talking with mom to assess the problem she is having. She explained that he doesn't want to latch. Said in the hospital he latched fine, lactation consultant watched him nurse and no concerns in hospital. No flat/inverted nipples. Said he latched for her after she had pumped and fed him some expressed breast milk. Discussed with her what engorgement is and it is possible he was having a hart time latching if her breasts were too full, since he latched well after she pumped. Recommended if engorged to express some milk before nursing, put some breastmilk on nipple before having him latch on.  Verified she understood to watch for wet diapers, hearing him swallow to know he is drinking milk when nursing, etc.  Reminded her to rest as much as possible and drink lots of fluids for milk supply.\n\nMom planned to call WIC and/or Mercy lactation number to see if she could get assistance with either of those options. Told her I would call her this afternoon either after I heard from VNS about lactation options through them or if I haven't heard from them to check with her and see what she found out on her with WIC or Mercy.

He sounds much better than he was when I talked to him last week. He is able to almost eat a full sandwich and states that he has gained 4 lbs in the last week. He is also walking at least 1/2 a mile every day. \n\nThe sharp pain that he had in his abdomen is no longer there but he does still have some gurgling that happens in his stomach at times, but there is no pain. \n\nHe did have some questions about immunizations. Dr. Franco told him that he needs to get 4 immunizations. I explained to him that since they took part of his spleen they will need to do a lot of his childhood immunizations again. I explained that some of them will have multiple doses and he may have to go back a few times to get them done. I let him know that he could do it at the Carlisle office. He wanted to know if he should get a flu shot. I told him to talk to the doc that he sees. The big push for influenza is past, but we have still been seeing patients who have influenza so it is possible that they may want him to get another one. \n\nJay does not have any concerns at this time. I told him that if anything comes up then he could call me at anytime. I let him know that I am going to keep following up with him weekly, but he can call me at any time with questions or concerns.",1489177364956,"user_225",27,"timeline",null,"Medium and Low Risk Discharge Activity Bundle"

This worker and Ms. Hill signed release again and she wishes for packet to be sent in anyway to ensure they receive it. She signed a release for medical records/supporting documentation for SSA application to be sent to SSA. \n\nProvided her with application for health and disability waiver and packet of information about the waiver. Talked through the application process. She believes it may help her but would like to look through information. She asked this worker for the website to apply for food assistance and to set up an account to track her SSDI application on line. Offered to do both these with her but she indicated she has a lot to think through and would prefer to do these at home. Wrote down both websites for her after pulling them up on the computer. \n\nThen this worker talked with her about counseling services again. She shared her hesitation is at the government being able to obtain information (other than medical) about personal things going on for her. Offered to meet with her individually for as long as needed to be someone to talk with and let her know my services are not ‘billable’ and this worker could be vague and not place any details within note.

Discussed her needs around her medication and cost and she explained those needs and concerns to this worker. She currently takes vials of insulin – 2 types. She would like the pens and would like to receive medications at no cost. We discussed a place to start may be AmeriHealth. We discussed that due to her carpal tunnel, she is unable to give herself an injection very well using vials and prefers the pens. She currently pays nothing/no co-pay for the vials/syringe. 3 way called AmeriHealth. They transferred us to AmeriHealth pharmacist. She indicated that they approved as of earlier today her receiving a pen for both of her insulins instead of a syringe. They did approve novalog instead of Humalog. This worker called the pharmacy – Hyvee Pharmacy on Army post. Pharmacist indicated he needs a verbal back from the doctor’s office that it is okay to give novalog instead of Humalog. He also needs an order for needles for pens, as Ms. Cox asked this worker to ask that question. Contacted Sue at Mercy Briarwood. She is going to call the pharmacy after talking with Dr. Hood.

He is wondering what else he can do to tweek his diet as he is wanting to lose another 13 lbs.  He would really like to have knee surgery, but they want him to lose 13 lbs before they do that.  \n\nWe discussed making sure that he is eating low fat options.  He eats milk every day with his oatmeal.  He is using skim milk for this.  I let him know that making sure he is eating low fat cheese and dairy products is an easy way to cut the calories.  We also discussed getting rid of any process foods to help with his fat intake every day.  He said that his wife does most of the planning for meals and he would like me to email her this information.  \n\nOn Sundays they prep their food for the week so this makes it easier for them during the week.  His wife would like low carb options for meals.  He feels like he is in a rut and need new options.  I gave him two diabetic low carb cooking books that we give out to patients.  I told him that I would also help find some online resources for them.  \n\nWe discussed increasing his exercise.

She can not remember the name of it but it is a step down from what she was taking before.  \n\nShe states that she sleeps well at night and wakes up in the morning with minimal pain, but by around 3:00 pm every day she starts to have pain.  By 6:00 pm she is having enough pain where she will break down and take a pain pill.  \n\nShe is no longer going to physical therapy.  She did have a blood blister that showed up on her left knee.  It popped and left a wound on her leg that Dr. Fish had her putting a cream on it.  \n\nThere is no drainage coming from her incision.  She states that she feels like the leg can be hot at times, but denies having a fever.  \n\nHer husband helps her around the house a lot.  She feels like she is experiencing more pain with this than she thought that she would.  \n\nI explained that everyone has different experiences with knee replacements.  Some people are able to sail through it with no pain, but others seem to struggle.  \n\nShe follows up with Dr. Fish on 12/12/2016.

She said Daryl is doing pretty good she thinks. He is looking better to her anyway. He's not gotten much energy back but she realizes it's early. She said he has a bed sore on his buttocks right between his cheeks below the tailbone. She's putting neosporin with lidocaine on it and using a barrier cream over that while covering it all with a 4x4. \n\nDaryl came to the hospital this morning for blood work. He was to have his INR checked. He's currently on 5mg tablets, 1/2 tablet by mouth daily. Patient has f/u appointments with Iowa Heart on 12/6 and 1/9 with the surgeon. Hazel tried to schedule with Dr. Wells today, she said she is waiting on a call back. She also asked about Public Health and said she might be interested in having a nurse come in and check his vitals and also collect blood for INRs so patient wouldn't have to get out at this time. She will discuss that with Dr. Wells when they come f/u with him.\n\nI advised Hazel that I will stay in touch and she too can reach out if she needs anything. Medications were reconciled with hospital list.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronically Signed by: Lisa Skinner, LPN -Author on November 28, 2016 11:47:42 AM",1480355477267,"user_158",22,"timeline",null,"Discharge Bundle"

Also called public health who sets up her medications to go make med change. Deidre who is on call d/t Kelly patient's regular nurse being out of the office will go make the change today. Patient will start the decreased dose tonight and she is going to check her blood pressures daily, record them and I will be in touch with her in a week to see how she's getting along. She will call meanwhile if she has any concerns.\n\nDate: Dec  8 2016  2:09PM     Creator: wudwho\nYes, she doesn't tolerate pressures below 140 systolic very well, in my experience.  So, let's cut doxazosin in half for now. DWH\n\nDate: Dec  8 2016  1:26PM     Creator: wulmsk\nPatient is checking blood sugars, but only once in the morning. She has been running 109, 114, 130 and BP on 12/4 was 137/54 and she said she checked it yesterday but couldn't find where she wrote it down, but said it was \"good\" or what it normally is, she didn't think it was to low. Diastolic was in the 50s she thinks, systolic 120-130s. She's okay with speech eval, I will order that, do you still want med change since BP doesn't seem to be lower than her \"normal?\"\n\nDate: Dec  8 2016 12:44PM     Creator: wudwho\n1. Is she checking blood sugars? 2. More suspect her BP is low.  Suggest she decrease doxazosin to 1mg daily. 3. No way should she have 'acid' reflux on pantoprazole and ranitidine...dysphagia may be related to her stroke.? speech therapy eval.\n\nDate: Dec  8 2016 12:15PM     Creator: wulmsk\nCalled patient today to check in with her, she says she's not been feeling very good. She was very dizzy yesterday, but is much better today. She still says she \"doesn't feel quite right\" but dizziness is definitely better. If she sits in the chair, she didn't feel right, but wasn't as bad until she tried moving around. She thought maybe it was her eyes, she has an eye appointment scheduled for 12/29. Patient also states she has been having trouble swallowing, she feels food gets caught so she just tried sticking with her Glucerna only yesterday and said she still had trouble with acid reflux to the point of vomiting and rolaids didn't seem to help at all. Advised Ruby I would make Dr. Hoch aware and get back with her with any recommendations from him. This health coach wondered about blood sugar causing dizziness if all she had yesterday was her Glucerna, patient wasn't sure if that may be the case.\n\n \n\n\n\nAssessment \nDizziness     780.4/R42\n\nDysphagia     787.20/R13.10\n\n\n\nPlan \nOrdersSpeech Therapy Consult (SPE01) - 787.20/R13.10 - 12/08/2016 \nMedicationsdoxazosin 2 mg oral tablet \nSIG: take 0.5 tablet by oral route daily \nDISP: (15) Unspecified with 11 refills\nAdjusted on 12/08/2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronically Signed by: Lisa Skinner, LPN -Author on December 8, 2016 02:32:43 PM",1481229353112,"user_158",null,"timeline",null,undefined
